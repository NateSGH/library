# Library

Small Library app using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS with:

- A form that allows user to add new books
- A button to handle the read status of the book
- A remove button.

Books data book data is not stored anywhere (for now), so when the user refreshes the page all of added books will disappear.

This project is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s curriculum.
